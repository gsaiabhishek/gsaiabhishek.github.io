                <p>August 14, 2022</p>
                <p>To<br>Sita Mahalakshmi</p>
                <p>
                  The emotion of Sita Ramam can't be typed in words, but let me try. It's an unparalleled love story filled with great music 
                  and lyrics, shot vibrantly in beautiful locations with actors pouring their soul into the characters. 
                  It is a story illustrating how the destiny can 
                  break hearts and in some cases, lives. It is a story built upon promise, unwavering love and thus sacrifice.
                  Didn't think tears would roll in my eyes, at least the second time, but they did!<br>
                  <br>
                  The story telling kept me on hook till the end. The attention that went into making the movie a retro deserves 
                  a ton of appreciation. The way various details are linked is very thoughtful. I have found some such references, here they are:

                <p>
                  Story time! Alot happened when I went to watch the movie for the second time. The cab driver dropped me way
                  before I reached my house, assuming a wrong drop off location. Talked with him to get me home for an extra charge. 
                  Booked an auto from my home to the theatre for which I placed the pickup on the wrong street - I placed the  
                  pick up point using my location when I was in my room, which is closer to that wrong opposite street.
                  Ran around the block to catch that auto. Online payment didn't work when I reached the theatre. I was late by around 
                  25 minutes. But guess what, the movie screening was delayed by 15 minutes and I was just in time. Luck? Destiny?
